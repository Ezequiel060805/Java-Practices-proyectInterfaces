# â˜• Java University Practice Projects

A collection of **Java exercises and mini-projects** developed during my university studies.  
This repository showcases my learning journey through **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **control structures**, **string manipulation**, and **Java application development**.

## â–¶ Compile & Run

### Using IDE
- Right-click the main class and select **Run**.

### Using Terminal (example)
```bash
javac src/Main.java
java -cp src Main
## ðŸ—„ Database-based Projects

If the project requires **MySQL**:

1. **Install MySQL server**.
2. **Create** the database and tables as described in the code.
3. **Update** the connection parameters (`user`, `password`, `database URL`) in the source files.

## ðŸŽ¯ Skills Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **String Handling:** Parsing, formatting, and processing text data.
- **Java Collections:** Lists, arrays, and maps.
- **Math Operations:** Calculations, numeric ranges, and user input processing.
- **Database Connectivity:** Using JDBC with MySQL.
- **Project Structure & Build Tools:** Understanding `build.xml` and project manifests.
